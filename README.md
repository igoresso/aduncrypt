A containerized DNS privacy solution combining [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome), [Unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/), and [DNSCrypt-proxy](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy) for enhanced privacy and ad-blocking. This project was inspired by [AdGuard-WireGuard-Unbound-DNScrypt](https://github.com/trinib/AdGuard-WireGuard-Unbound-DNScrypt). The goal is to streamline the original multi-step manual installation into a single, easy-to-deploy container while maintaining compatibility with standard AdGuard Home volume mappings.

## ✨ Features

- **Ad & tracker blocking** with AdGuard Home
- **DNS caching and DNSSEC validation** via [Unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) recursive resolver
- **Encrypted DNS** through DNSCrypt-proxy with ODoH ([Oblivious DNS-over-HTTPS](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Oblivious-DoH))
- **Anonymized routing** through relay servers for enhanced privacy
- **Automatic root hints updates** every 6 months via cron
- **Ready-to-deploy** with Podman/Docker Compose

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Install Podman and Podman Compose:

```bash
sudo apt install podman podman-compose
```

### System Configuration

1. **Enable privileged port binding** (required for DNS port 53):
   By default, rootless Podman doesn't allow exposing a privileged port (<1024). Unless you are happy to use an unconventional DNS port to avoid an error, run:

```bash
echo "net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=53" | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/20-dns-privileged-port.conf
```

2. **Optimize kernel buffers**:
   Unbound is configured with a larger kernel buffer so that no messages are lost during spikes in the traffic. To match the parameters in `unbound/unbound.conf` run:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=4194304
sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=4194304
```

Reboot for changes to apply.

### Deployment

Download this repo and spin up a container:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igoresso/aduncrypt.git
cd aduncrypt
podman-compose up -d
```

### Initial Setup

1. **Access AdGuard Home** at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Follow the setup wizard** - when asked which interface to listen on, keep **All interfaces**

### Configure AdGuard Home

1. Delete everything from both **Upstream** and **Bootstrap DNS servers** options and add the following addresses to point at the Unbound resolver:

   - `127.0.0.1:5053` (Unbound)
   - `127.0.0.1:5353` (Direct fallback to Oblivious DNS over HTTPS)

2. Put a tick ☑️ next to **Parallel Request** option.
3. In DNS settings, set **DNS cache size** to `0` (caching is handled by Unbound)
4. Add blocklists in **Filters** → **DNS blocklists**:
   - [Blocklists and Allowlists Sources](https://github.com/T145/black-mirror)

### Host System DNS Configuration

**Disable systemd-resolved** (if running):

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
# Set:
# DNS=127.0.0.1
# DNSStubListener=no
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

**Update system resolver**:

```bash
# Check current configuration
cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Should contain: nameserver 127.0.0.1
# If not, update it:
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
```

### Enable Auto-Start (Optional)

After completing initial setup, switch to the secure systemd deployment using Podman Quadlet (needs podman version >= 4.4):

```bash
# Stop compose (no longer needed)
podman-compose down

# Create systemd directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/containers/systemd

# Copy the quadlet container file to the systemd directory
cp aduncrypt.container ~/.config/containers/systemd/aduncrypt.container

# Reload systemd to recognize the new quadlet
systemctl --user daemon-reload

# Enable and start the service
systemctl --user enable --now aduncrypt.service

# Enable lingering for auto-start on boot
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER

# Enable auto-updates
systemctl --user enable --now podman-auto-update.timer
```

### Alternative: Keep Using Compose

If you prefer manual management:

```bash
# Just restart when needed
podman-compose up -d
```

**Note**: Manual restart required after system reboot.

### Verify everything is working

```bash

# Check service status (if using Quadlet)
systemctl --user status aduncrypt.service

# Check container is running
podman ps

# View logs (if using compose)
podman-compose logs -f aduncrypt

# Test DNS resolution
dig @127.0.0.1 google.com

# Test auto-update capability
podman auto-update --dry-run

# Monitor logs (if using Quadlet)
journalctl --user -u aduncrypt.service -f
```

## 🧪 Verification

Test your DNS setup with these tools:

- [1.1.1.1 Help](https://1.1.1.1/help) - Basic connectivity test
- [BrowserLeaks DNS](https://browserleaks.com/dns) - Should show "Cloudflare" if nothing is changed
- [DNSCheck Tools](https://dnscheck.tools/) - Comprehensive DNS analysis

## 📊 Ports

### Default Ports

| Port | Protocol | Service  | Description                             |
| ---- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 53   | TCP/UDP  | DNS      | Primary DNS resolver                    |
| 80   | TCP      | HTTP     | AdGuard Home web panel                  |
| 3000 | TCP      | HTTP     | Initial setup **(disable after setup)** |
| 5053 | TCP/UDP  | Internal | Unbound DNS resolver                    |
| 5353 | TCP/UDP  | Internal | DNSCrypt-proxy                          |

**Note**: The quadlet configuration doesn't expose port 3000. Complete the initial AdGuard Home setup using the compose method first, then switch to quadlet for production deployment.

### Optional Ports

The following ports are commented out in `compose.yml` but can be enabled as needed. For quadlet users, add them to your `aduncrypt.container` file using `PublishPort=` directives:

| Port | Protocol | Service       | Description                   |
| ---- | -------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 443  | TCP/UDP  | HTTPS         | AdGuard Home web panel HTTPS  |
| 784  | UDP      | DNS-over-QUIC | Modern encrypted DNS protocol |
| 853  | TCP      | DNS-over-TLS  | Encrypted DNS over TLS        |
| 67   | UDP      | DHCP Server   | Dynamic IP assignment         |
| 68   | UDP      | DHCP Client   | DHCP client responses         |

## 🔧 Customization

Unbound is configured to use [Oblivious DNS-over-HTTPS](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Oblivious-DoH) via `dnscrypt-proxy`. DNS over TLS is querying Cloudflare upstream endpoints. All configuration files are mounted as volumes for easy customization:

- **`unbound/unbound.conf`** - Unbound DNS resolver settings
- **`dnscrypt/dnscrypt-proxy.toml`** - DNSCrypt-proxy configuration
- **`adguard/adguard/opt-adguard-conf`** - AdGuard Home configuration
- **`adguard/adguard/opt-adguard-work`** - AdGuard Home data

You have full control to adjust the configuration as you see fit.
